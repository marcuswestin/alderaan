* Create split view with multiple files open
* Remove header, and all the features
* Fix small and large font sizes - cursor is off 
* Add search over all files - front end or back end?
* Rename - BespinMate, BespMate?
* Add file open by typing name of file (cmd-T in TextMate)

* Should be able to load settings from any URL
* Should be able to import any project from e.g. github

(Start digging into the command line, and see what it's capable of)

* Load entire project directory structure upon startup
    * Create refresh command that reload state from backend
* Password protect projects?
* Make sure bespin_get_file is really secure - there can't be a way to access parent directories, or it'll be a huge security hole
* Move all DOM creation from HTML to CSS
* Add git command to pipe input in and out of git
    * How do we make this secure? Do we have to?


(DONE) * Create file tree of current project
