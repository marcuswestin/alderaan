TODO - good stuff to work on

==== 1 =================

* Create split view with multiple files open
* Make command line execute any commands - just pipe input and output back and forth
* Rename - BespinMate, BespMate?
* Make sure bespin_get_file is really secure - there can't be a way to access parent directories, or it'll be a huge security hole
    * Clean up path names in general. Shouldn't have a bunch of // and /./ in there

==== 2 =================

* Remove header, and all the features
* Add file open by typing name of file (cmd-T in TextMate)
* Create refresh command that reloads file tree and text file state from backend
* Password protection?
* Move all DOM creation from HTML to CSS

==== 3 =================

* Fix small and large font sizes - cursor is off 
* Add search over all files - front end or back end?
* Should be able to load settings from any URL
* Should be able to import any project from e.g. github

==== ? ==================
* Load entire project directory structure upon startup
